Lab Meeting 21/11/2020


Meeting Minutes: 80 minutes


-bus vs harvard implementation - work towards doing bus implementation (Harvard has separate data areas for instructions and other data, and can be quickly done together if we don’t have time and haven’t got a working implementation).


-Data Sheet, we can make at the end (Aryan can take lead on this one when the time comes?).


-Focus on functionality over efficiency, however there is a hard limit of CPI 36 worst case. Trim, performance is not a marking factor.


-waitrequest from Avalon spec allows for arbitrary delays in order to maintain instruction integrity.


-Cache implementation needed to avoid fetch delays from memory.


-reset: Sets all registers to 0, PC set to 0xBFC0000, start of 4MB region. PC also meant to be 0? Chase up which is correct.


-Delegation of roles:
        -Chern: Instructions, decode
        -Justin and Ben: Testbenches
        -Tian: Memory Access
        -Aryan: Assembler


-Make your own branches to work on the Git to avoid merge conflicts if ever.


-Skeleton to be finished by 7th Dec (16 days), half of instructions and test-bench/cases, barebones of assembler by that point.


-Aim to have the whole project finished by the sanity check (16th Dec).


-Weekly meetings to be held on Saturdays.
