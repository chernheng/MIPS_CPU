check main functionality
- use largest positive/largest negative/0s

edge cases
j type - j to itself
       - j to reset vector
       - j to branch delay slot
       - j in branch delay slot of another j

arithmetic operations (immediate)
-check sign extension/0 extended
-overflow
-rd = $zero

branches(pcnext+immediate)
-wrap around
-immediate=0
-reset in branch delay slot? (store a branch instr in BCE000000)

lw
-load into $zero
-load from reset vector
-load from halt
-for load <32 bit check sign extension

sw(check little endian)
-change instr memory
-change reset vector
-change halt 
-invalid address (not BCF000 + 8x)

jalr
- rd=$zero

r-type arithetic
- rd=$zero
- overflow

and link
- addiu $v0 $r31 0


no edge case?
mthi
mtlo
shifts - just check correct bits shifted in? (negative & positive number shifted)
slt

not pipelined - no data hazards

mem[imm+base] negative immediate
- would any cpu be designed such that the immediate gets sign extended?
